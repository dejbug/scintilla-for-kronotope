# scintilla-for-kronotope

This is an **unofficial** Scintilla build. Also it's **Win32-only** for now: all irrevelant files are missing. The point is to modify the control so that [kronotope](https://github.com/dejbug/kronotope) works as intended, hopefully improving the control's design along the way.

The starting point is the [scintilla420.tgz](https://www.scintilla.org/scintilla420.tgz) (Release 4.2.0) as found [here](https://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDownload.html); only deletions were applied to the `scintilla` folder prior to initial commit.

Feel free, if you like anything here, to forward it as patches to the official [Feature Request Tracker](https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/feature-requests), saving me the troubles. Thanks!
